This is he start of an amazing custom browser that I will countinue to update, right now the browser has a fully working search engine that is really easy to update and add more urls and keywords in. The browser also has commands alone with the start of an entire
scripting luanguage called SimpleScript, wich has a lot of working components like if statments, user inputs, print statment, and more(more funtctions will be added soon). And a more recent update I did was the start of a 3d render for the browser called BetterBuild.
console.log("more updates comming soon!");
